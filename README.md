Compose is a very easy-to-use UI framework. In this application, Compose's state feature helps us quickly build a data-driven interface. For example, when you click on the pet details interface, we can see that the button changes, and Using the native Toast, a toast pops up, and these interactions are very simple to implement with Jetpack Compose!
